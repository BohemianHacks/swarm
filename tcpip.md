Key Features of the TCP/IP Packet Generator:

1. Configurable IP Address Ranges
- Randomized source and destination IP generation
- Supports custom IP range specifications

2. Flexible Packet Generation
- Multiple protocols (TCP/UDP)
- Configurable TCP flags
- Variable payload types
- Customizable packet size

3. Training Data Capabilities
- Generates diverse packet sequences
- Supports saving to PCAP format for model training
- Multiple payload generation strategies

4. Advanced Payload Generation
- Random byte sequences
- Zero-filled payloads
- Repeating pattern payloads

Usage Recommendations:
- Install Scapy: `pip install scapy`
- Numpy: `pip install numpy`
- Run with root/admin privileges for packet sending
- Customize IP ranges and packet parameters as needed

Potential Improvements:
- Add more sophisticated payload generation
- Implement protocol-specific packet generation
- Enhanced error handling
- More granular flag and option configurations

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the packet generator? I can provide guidance on using it for model training, customization strategies, or explain the implementation details.
