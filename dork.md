**Important Considerations and Ethical Use:**
1. This script is designed for security research and penetration testing purposes.
2. Always ensure you have explicit permission before performing reconnaissance on any domain you do not own.
3. Be aware of potential legal and ethical implications of using Google dork searches.

**Prerequisites:**
Before running the script, you'll need to install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install googlesearch-python fake-useragent
```

**Usage Examples:**
1. Basic search for a domain:
```bash
python3 google_dork_script.py --domain example.com
```

2. Increase results per dork and save to a file:
```bash
python3 google_dork_script.py --domain example.com --results 20 --output results.txt
```

**Key Features:**
- Generates multiple types of Google dork queries
- Randomizes user agents to avoid potential blocking
- Optional result saving
- Configurable number of results per query

**Potential Improvements:**
- Add proxy support
- Implement more sophisticated error handling
- Add more diverse dork queries
- Implement rate limiting to prevent potential IP blocks
